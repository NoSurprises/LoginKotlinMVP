# LoginKotlinMVP 
## Kotlin
It's my first complete app in kotlin. No serious features were used, i'm just getting used to the new language. Maybe later i'll refactor some lines, so 
that resources will be used properly and some advanced kotlin features may find a place in the sun in my app. Now it's written pretty 
straightforward and dumb af. Anyway, it's all about architecture...
## MVP
After reading several articles and watching a buch of videos about MVP android architecture, i've finally implemented it by myself. 
It gave me a decent understanding of this pattern. The following apps will be be structered this way, as I found MVP effectively convenient and splendid.
## Login app
Simple app with 2 activities: Login (and sign up) and main. User can either login or create a new account. The state of account saved to SP.
